COMMON C# PATTERNS USED
-----------------------

1. PROPERTIES:
   public bool IsActive { get; set; }
   - Encapsulates fields with automatic getters/setters

2. LINQ QUERIES:
   bullets.Where(b => b.IsActive).ToList()
   - Functional programming for data filtering

3. OBJECT INITIALIZATION:
   new Vector2(x, y) { X = 10, Y = 20 }
   - Clean object creation syntax

4. NULL-CONDITIONAL OPERATORS:
   soundManager?.PlaySound("shoot")
   - Safe method calls on potentially null objects

5. STRING INTERPOLATION:
   $"Score: {score}"
   - Modern string formatting

6. COLLECTION INITIALIZERS:
   new List<int> { 1, 2, 3 }
   - Concise collection creation

DEBUGGING TIPS
--------------
• Use breakpoints to examine object states
• Watch the game loop flow in Update/Draw methods
• Monitor collection sizes for memory leaks
• Use the debugger to trace collision detection
• Examine vector calculations step by step

PERFORMANCE TIPS
----------------
• Object pooling reduces garbage collection pressure
• Avoid creating new objects in Update loops
• Use efficient collision detection (broad phase first)
• Cache frequently used calculations
• Profile your code to find bottlenecks
